# Dither tools
<b>Dither â€” high-bit-depth tools for AviSynth</b>

This package offers a set of tools to manipulate Stacked Hacked [high-bit-depth](http://avisynth.nl/index.php/High_bit-depth_Support_with_Avisynth) (16 bits per plane) video clips.

The most prominent features are color banding artifact removal,
dithering to 8 bits, colorspace conversions and resizing.

Additionally, some existing filters ([dfttest](http://avisynth.nl/index.php/Dfttest), MDegrain from [MVTools](http://avisynth.nl/index.php/MVTools), etc)
have been modified to handle 16-bit clips.
See [High bit-depth Support with Avisynth](http://avisynth.nl/index.php/High_bit-depth_Support_with_Avisynth) for more information.
